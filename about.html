        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>The "Why"</h3>
	<p>Hi, I'm Aidan Lenahan, a junior at Red Bank Regional High School, and I've been walking dogs professionally since 2021. 
	I have always been a "dog person," which is why I started to walk dogs and also why I was eager to start a donation drive to help dogs who may not be comfortable or content.</p>
	<h3>Inspiration</h3>	
	<p>I was inspired to structure this donation drive the way it is by <strong><a href="https://dermerdreams.org/">Dermer Dreams</a></strong>, a local food drive founded in Fair Haven, NJ, 
	which collects their donations by distributing bags and flyers onto the doorsteps of neighbors. 
	On a certain date, the neighbors are told to put their bags outside and the neighborhood captains who signed up to collect the bags will do so 
	and drop them off at a centralized location. At the end of the day, these items are sent off to several different organizations, 
	including <strong><a href="https://lunchbreak.org/">Lunchbreak</a></strong> and other local food banks.</p>
