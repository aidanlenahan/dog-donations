        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Every day, unwanted, mistreated, and homeless dogs are sent into shelters and pounds. It could take weeks or months for these dogs to find their rightful home. 
	During those weeks or months being unadopted, they lay in their crate, unentertained and uncomfortable. We--<strong>you</strong>--can change that!</p>
	<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.aspca.org/about-us">ASPCA</a></strong> actively prevents animal cruelty and strengthens animal protection laws through advocacy efforts. 
	Donations to the ASPCA fund critical rescue operations, provide blankets, toys, food, education programs, advocacy campaigns, and emergency response initiatives across the nation.</p>
	<h3>How it works</h3>
	<p>The ASPCA needs all the help they can get. If you have any blankets or towels, dog toys, unopened dog food, perfect!</p>
	<p>First, sign up for a bag and flyer to be delivered to your doorstep. You can sign up by clicking here or by clicking 
	the button in the navigation bar at the top of your screen. The form will ask for your name, address, email, and phone number.
	Then, at THIS date before THIS time, please leave the bag provided filled with any donated items.
	After TIME on that day, I will pick up these bags and drop them off at the nearest ASPCA location.</p>
	<p><strong>Any</strong> donation is appreciated, no matter how big or small. Your donation will make a difference, along with many others' generosity.</p>
